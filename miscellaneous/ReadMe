📞 Tee Networks — Enquiries & Contact Form
🧩 Overview

This project contains the Enquiries Page for Tee Networks, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The page allows users to submit their enquiries through a modern, validated form with smooth styling and responsive design.

🌐 Page Description

The Enquiries Page lets users:

Enter their full name, email address, subject, and message.

Get real-time validation before submission.

See visual feedback for successful or invalid inputs.

Experience a clean, responsive design that adapts to all devices.

│
└── Assets/
    └── (images, logos, and media)

🎨 CSS (styles.css)

The CSS file provides modern styling for the Enquiries page, including:

A centered enquiry card with rounded corners and shadows.

Soft background gradient and glassmorphism-style effects.

Input focus transitions for better user experience.

Distinct colors for success and error states.

Example CSS snippet:

.enquiry-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  padding: 2rem;
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 3rem auto;
}

input:focus, textarea:focus {
  border-color: #00bcd4;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 188, 212, 0.6);
}

⚙️ JavaScript (validateForm.js)

The validation script ensures the form is filled out correctly before submission.

✅ Features:

Checks for empty fields.

Validates proper email format.

Ensures the message has at least 10 characters.

Shows instant visual feedback and prevents form submission if errors exist.

Example JavaScript snippet:

document.getElementById("contactForm").addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  const name = document.getElementById("name").value.trim();
  const email = document.getElementById("email").value.trim();
  const message = document.getElementById("message").value.trim();
  const feedback = document.getElementById("form-feedback");

  if (!name || !email || !message) {
    feedback.textContent = "⚠️ Please fill in all required fields.";
    feedback.style.color = "#ff4d4d";
    return;
  }

  const emailPattern = /^[^ ]+@[^ ]+\.[a-z]{2,3}$/;
  if (!email.match(emailPattern)) {
    feedback.textContent = "❌ Please enter a valid email address.";
    feedback.style.color = "#ff4d4d";
    return;
  }

  if (message.length < 10) {
    feedback.textContent = "📝 Message must be at least 10 characters long.";
    feedback.style.color = "#ff4d4d";
    return;
  }

  feedback.textContent = "✅ Your enquiry has been submitted successfully!";
  feedback.style.color = "#00c853";
  document.getElementById("contactForm").reset();
});

💡 How It Works

Open Enquiries.html in your browser.

Fill in your name, email, subject, and message.

Try submitting with invalid details — you’ll see error messages.

Correct your inputs and submit again — a success message will appear.

📱 Responsive Design

The form automatically adapts to smaller screens.

Buttons and inputs resize for mobile use.

No overlapping or disappearing text on any device.
